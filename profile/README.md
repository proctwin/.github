Platform and sensor technologies for sustainable steel manufacturing

The steel manufacturing value chain plays a critical role in the transition to more sustainable practices, processes and solutions. The EU-funded ProcTwin project aims to support these efforts by developing a key demonstration platform that predicts and visualises the optimal use of multiple processing steps throughout the steel manufacturing chain. The project will implement a methodology that combines numerical simulations, process data, distributed machine learning, soft sensors and other tools to identify the best options for smart optimisation, focusing on energy efficiency and product quality. These innovations will help optimise processes, reduce carbon emissions and facilitate the transition to more sustainable solutions.
